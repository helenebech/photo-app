For this project i have used generative AI, specifically for the correct functionality in images.js and app.js. I also used ChatGPT to clean up/shorten my code in style.css. I have asked ChatGPT for help along the way, and tried to do my best. 

I have also watched a YouTube-video, "Build A REST API With Node.js, Express, & MongoDB - Quick", to understand how to set up an application as I have never done it by myself before. Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgTGADljAeg
