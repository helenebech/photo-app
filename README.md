For this project i have used generative AI (ChatGPT), specifically for the correct functionality in images.js and app.js. I also used ChatGPT to clean up/shorten my code in style.css. 

I have watched a YouTube-video, "Build A REST API With Node.js, Express, & MongoDB - Quick", to understand how to set up an application.
